# GitHub Copilot Lens

> **See everything Copilot does — in real time.**

Ever wondered what's happening behind the scenes when GitHub Copilot CLI is working? Copilot Lens gives you a live dashboard showing every turn, tool call, agent chain, and token — right inside VS Code.

## Why Copilot Lens?

🔍 **Full Transparency** — Watch Copilot think, plan, and execute in real time

🤖 **Multi-Agent Visibility** — See the full agent hierarchy: PM calls backend-developer, backend-developer calls tester — every chain visualized

🛠️ **Tool Call Inspector** — Click any tool badge to see exactly what command was run, what file was edited, what was searched

📊 **Session Analytics** — Turns, tokens, tools, agents, checkpoints, modified files — all at a glance

## Highlights

**Agent Call Trees** — When Copilot spawns sub-agents, see the full parent→child tree with tool badges, results, and timing for each agent.
